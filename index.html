        <h1>Welcome to CSS Animations Excercise</h1>
        <h4>
          CSS Animations are very useful in creating an engaging user experience
          on your website. In this session, we will learn a few useful ways to
          use CSS Animations by applying transitions, scroll effects, and
          keyframe animations to specific elements on this page. We will also
          learn a little bit about box shadows to give some elements like
          buttons or divs an elevated look.

        <p>
          Mostly triggered when you click on a link. This CSS property lets us
          define whether the browser jumps to a new location or animates
          smoothly to the location when a user clicks a link that targets a
          location within the same page.

        <p>
          <span>Your Task: </span>Currently, when you click on the Exercise
          links in the Navbar above, it jumps to the location of the selected
          exercise. Change this behavior to smoothly animate scrolling to the
          selected exercise.

        <h3 id="exercise2">EXERCISE 2: CSS Transform Property</h3>
        <p>
          The Transform property allows us to apply 2D or 3D transformation
          effects to an element. These effects can be combined with the
          animation property or the html element states (:focus, :hover,
          :active, etc) to create useful visual cues to your users such as
          button press effect, sliding an object from one point to another, etc.

          effect when it is clicked.

          <span>Tip: </span>Apply the effect on the :active state of the
          element.

        <h3 id="exercise3">EXERCISE 3: CSS Transitions</h3>
        <p>
          The transition property allows us to change values of elements over a
          period of time. This property requires a trigger to run. The trigger
          could be a change in the element state (example :hover), or a
          Javascript event. Key differences between Transitions and Animations
          are:
        </p>

        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            Transitions require a trigger to start and Animations do not require
            one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transitions can change only between two states while Animations can
            change between multiple states.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transitions cannot run in a loop while Animations can run as many
            times as we want.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="exercise4">EXERCISE 4: CSS Keyframe Animations</h3>
        <p>
          The animation property allows us to animate transitions from one state
          to another or through multiple states. There are two main components
          for css animations; a style that describes the animation and keyframes
          that specify the start and end states of the animation’s style.
          Animations are autonomous and do not require a trigger before they
          start. They can however respond to triggers from Javascript or a
          change in the CSS state (e.g. :hover, :active, etc).
        </p>

        <p><span>Your Task: </span></p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li class="listItem">
            Create a box to change its border radius to 50%, and animate to the
            right by 960px while going up 90px and down to its original
            position. Bonus points if you can reverse it to its original
            position.
          </li>
          <li class="listItem">
            Animate the arrow at the top of this page to continuously point

        <h3 id="exercise5">EXERCISE 5: Animation Libraries</h3>
        <p>
          There are also a ton of animation libraries that can be used on your
          website to create quick animation effects. An example of such
          libraries is the AOS(Animate On Scroll) library.
        </p>
        <p>
          One key benefit of using animation libraries is that they are fairly
          easy to set up on your website and save a lot of time coding
          animations in css. The disadvantage to using libraries is that we have
          do not have full control over the animation and they could have
          negative impact on website performance as the libraries have to be
          loaded first before they can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Your Task: </span>Using the Animate On Scroll(AOS) library,
          animate the heading of this exercise to zoom-in when you scroll to
          this exercise.
